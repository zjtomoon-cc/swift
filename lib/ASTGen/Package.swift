// swift-tools-version: 5.9

// The CMake build system is the only one that's able to produce a working
// compiler. This Package.swift makes it easier to build and work with the
// swiftASTGen library within IDEs, but it's mainly there for editing---it
// won't create something that can be meaningfully executed. Most things with
// the new Swift parser are better implemented/tested within or on top of the
// swift-syntax package.

// To successfully build, you'll need to create a couple of symlinks to an
// existing Ninja build:
//
// ln -s <project-root>/build/<Ninja-Build>/llvm-<os+arch> <project-root>/build/Default/llvm
// ln -s <project-root>/build/<Ninja-Build>/swift-<os+arch> <project-root>/build/Default/swift
//
// where <project-root> is the parent directory of the swift repository.
//
// FIXME: We may want to consider generating Package.swift as a part of the
// build.
